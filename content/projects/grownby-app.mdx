## **Project Overview:**

At **GrownBy App**, we have created a user-friendly platform where farmers can directly connect with customers, offering fresh and locally sourced products. By facilitating direct transactions between farmers and consumers, our app not only promotes the growth of local agriculture but also ensures that consumers have access to high-quality, farm-fresh produce.

## **Key Features:**
1. **Farmers Empowerment:** GrownBy App empowers farmers, enabling them to showcase their products to a wider audience. It provides a dedicated space for farmers to list their offerings, reach customers nationwide, and build a loyal customer base.
2. **Seamless User Experience:** The app boasts an intuitive and engaging interface, making it effortless for users to browse through a diverse range of products, place orders, and track deliveries.

## **Tech Stack:**
- **TypeScript:**
    
     We leverage TypeScript to enhance code quality, making the app more robust, readable, and maintainable.
- **React Native:**
    
     Utilizing React Native ensures a seamless experience for both iOS and Android users, delivering native-like performance and responsiveness.
- **Firebase:**
    
     We rely on Firebase for backend support, enabling real-time data synchronization, secure authentication, and efficient cloud storage.
- **Google Cloud Provider:**
    
     Leveraging Google Cloud's Big Query and Maps API, we enhance the app with powerful geolocation features and data analytics, ensuring a personalized experience for users.
- **Jest:**
    
     To guarantee the app's reliability and stability, we employ Jest for comprehensive testing, covering unit tests, snapshots, and performance testing.

## **Project Impact:**

**GrownBy App** stands at the intersection of technology and agriculture, creating a positive impact on both farmers and consumers. By facilitating direct sales, farmers can earn fair prices for their products, while consumers gain access to fresh, locally sourced goods, supporting sustainable agriculture practices and reducing the carbon footprint associated with long-distance food transportation.
