## 🎯 About

IGnews is a news portal where users pay to have access. The user can only see full posts if they have an active Stripe subscription. if the user is not subscribed, he will only be able to read a summary of the posts.

The application's payment methods are integrated with the Stripe API, together with FaunaDB to store user information. posts are managed through CMS Prismic.io

The application is built with a **Serverless** model, without the need to create an external API to manipulate the data 🚀
